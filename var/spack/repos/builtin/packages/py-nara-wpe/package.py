    """Background noise and signal reverberation due to reflections in an
    enclosure are the two main impairments in acoustic signal processing and
    far-field speech recognition. This work addresses signal dereverberation
    techniques based on WPE for speech recognition and other far-field
    applications. WPE is a compelling algorithm to blindly dereverberate
    acoustic signals based on long-term linear prediction."""
