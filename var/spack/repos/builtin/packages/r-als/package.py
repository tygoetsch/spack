    """Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS).

    Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components contributing
    to data with a bilinear structure; the basic technique may be extended to
    alternating constrained least squares.  Commonly applied constraints
    include unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of components.
    Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by assuming that one
    of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is shared between
    datasets."""
