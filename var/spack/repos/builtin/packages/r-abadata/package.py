    Provides the data for the gene expression enrichment analysis conducted
    in the package 'ABAEnrichment'. The package includes three datasets
    which are derived from the Allen Brain Atlas: (1) Gene expression data
    from Human Brain (adults) averaged across donors, (2) Gene expression
    data from the Developing Human Brain pooled into five age categories and
    averaged across donors and (3) a developmental effect score based on the
    Developing Human Brain expression data. All datasets are restricted to
    protein coding genes."""
