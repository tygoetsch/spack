    """Vegetated Filter Strip and Erosion Model.

    Empirical models for runoff, erosion, and phosphorus loss across a
    vegetated filter strip, given slope, soils, climate, and vegetation (Gall
    et al., 2018) <doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1505-x>. It also includes functions
    for deriving climate parameters from measured daily weather data, and for
    simulating rainfall. Models implemented include MUSLE (Williams, 1975) and
    APLE (Vadas et al., 2009 <doi:10.2134/jeq2008.0337>)."""
