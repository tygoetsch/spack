    """Fast Generators and Iterators for Permutations, Combinations, Integer
    Partitions and Compositions.

    Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations, integer
    partitions and compositions. The arrangements are in lexicographical order
    and generated iteratively in a memory efficient manner. It has been
    demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most existing packages of
    similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at
    <https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html>."""
