    """Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes.

    Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently,
    several methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform
    hypothesis testing about the independence between the processes, a suitable
    nonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an
    F test for assessing the multiple correlation between one spatial process
    and several others. Functions for image processing and computing the
    spatial association between images are also provided."""
