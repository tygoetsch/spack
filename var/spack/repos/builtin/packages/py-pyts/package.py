    """pyts is a Python package for time series classification. It aims to make
    time series classification easily accessible by providing preprocessing and
    utility tools, and implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms. Most of
    these algorithms transform time series, thus pyts provides several tools to
    perform these transformations."""
