class Spectra(CMakePackage):
    """
    Spectra stands for Sparse Eigenvalue Computation Toolkit as a Redesigned
    ARPACK. It is a C++ library for large scale eigenvalue problems,
    built on top of Eigen, an open source linear algebra library.

    Spectra is implemented as a header-only C++ library, whose only
    dependency, Eigen, is also header-only. Hence Spectra can be easily
    embedded in C++ projects that require calculating eigenvalues of
    large matrices.
