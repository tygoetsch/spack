    """AutomaDeD (Automata-based Debugging for Dissimilar parallel
    tasks) is a tool for automatic diagnosis of performance and
    correctness problems in MPI applications. It creates
    control-flow models of each MPI process and, when a failure
    occurs, these models are leveraged to find the origin of
    problems automatically. MPI calls are intercepted (using
    wrappers) to create the models. When an MPI application hangs,
    AutomaDeD creates a progress-dependence graph that helps
    finding the process (or group of processes) that caused the hang.
