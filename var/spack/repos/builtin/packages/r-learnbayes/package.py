    LearnBayes contains a collection of functions helpful in learning the
    basic tenets of Bayesian statistical inference. It contains functions for
    summarizing basic one and two parameter posterior distributions and
    predictive distributions. It contains MCMC algorithms for summarizing
    posterior distributions defined by the user. It also contains functions for
    regression models, hierarchical models, Bayesian tests, and illustrations
    of Gibbs sampling."""
