    """Accurate Numerical Derivatives.

    Methods for calculating (usually) accurate numerical first and second order
    derivatives. Accurate calculations are done using 'Richardson"s'
    extrapolation or, when applicable, a complex step derivative is available.
    A simple difference method is also provided. Simple difference is (usually)
    less accurate but is much quicker than 'Richardson"s' extrapolation and
    provides a useful cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and
    vector valued functions."""
