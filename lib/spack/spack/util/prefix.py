    """This class represents an installation prefix, but provides useful attributes for referring
    to directories inside the prefix.

    Attributes of this object are created on the fly when you request them, so any of the following
    are valid:

    >>> prefix = Prefix("/usr")
    >>> prefix.bin
    /usr/bin
    >>> prefix.lib64
    /usr/lib64
    >>> prefix.share.man

    >>> prefix.foo.bar.baz
    /usr/foo/bar/baz
    >>> prefix.join("dashed-directory").bin64
    /usr/dashed-directory/bin64

    Prefix objects behave identically to strings. In fact, they subclass ``str``, so operators like
    ``+`` are legal::

        print("foobar " + prefix)

    This prints ``foobar /usr``. All of this is meant to make custom installs easy.
